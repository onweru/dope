### Goals
* Convert this theme into a jekyll website/theme

### background

Most of the projects that we'll work with will revolve around SSGs (Static Site Generators). I have chosen Jekyll as the static site generator to state with; and [with good reason](https://www.consagous.com/what-are-static-sites-why-jekyll-is-so-popular-now/) (there's alot of work in this area)

Look

Later on, it will be imperative that you learn **Hugo** (growing number of jobs in this area as well) ... assuming that you will even like this one, of course.


### Things that you will need 

#### 1. Learn Markdown Syntax
It's really easy and its [spec](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is really short. Shouldnt take you more than an hour.

> This document is written in markdown. All of it! 

#### 2. Learn how use sass
Writing plain css can be painfully repetitive. When writing hundreds or thousands lines of css code, this aspect of it can be entirely exhausting. SASS helps us be DRY (do not repeat yourself), by enabling you to use reusable variables, mixins, functions, maps, extends. I'm sure I'm repeating what is already out there. For that reason, I will advise that you start [here](https://raygun.com/blog/10-reasons-css-preprocessor/) and [here](https://codeburst.io/how-sass-can-save-you-a-lot-of-time-f1198b658012)


For all the reasons you will find, here is why I use **sass**

* Save my time
* Enables me to break my code into modular reusable components
* Make the process of writing fun

#### 3. Learn new css layout technologies 
Start with [grid css](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) then look for tutorials on youtube. [This css grid playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-slCsOrLcc&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG) is awesome, as is [this flexbox playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj7NZ6FiQvo&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid)

> Thou shalt not use floats. Seriously, don't

#### 4. Learn Jekyll
[Start here](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/) and be sure not to sign up for anything that requires you to pay. Exhaust everything on that page. Then move on to the [official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). While you are at it, feel free to check out [another great supplementary resource](https://blog.webjeda.com/)  

> We developers must enjoy reading docs :) lol

#### 5. Git is your friend.
Git is something that you will use in all your projects. I realize you may already be good in this. [Just in case though](https://try.github.io/), check for tutorials on youtube. You just need the basics to get started and progressively learn a few more tricks as you go by.

### Finally
There's alot of items I would include in this list. I think that would be somewhat overwhelming, thus unnecessary.  This list should suffice for now.

The best way to learn is to learn by doing.
