# Goals

- Convert [this html5 theme](https://html5up.net/dopetrope) into a jekyll website/theme

See [this repo's instructions wiki](https://github.com/onweru/dope/wiki/Conversion-Instructions) on how to go about it.

## Remaining Todos

- [ ] Replace all vendor js scripts with a single vanilla js file
- [ ] Cleanup the `_sass/_theme.scss` file further
- [ ] Replace the monolithic font-awesome with svg icons
- [ ] Edit the `_includes/nav.html` such that the links are not hardcoded
- [ ] Ensure that buttons' text isn't hardcoded
